Welcome to My Shell Version 1.0 - Release by Yousif Kako

- ALL of the commands should work accordingly
- Exec'ed programs can take n amount of flags
- NOTE: If you want to call a batch file you may redirect it when you call
  the program. EXAMPLE: Linux --> bash> ./Shell < cmd.txt
  but if you want to do that... please commant out line 35: printf("%s>", pwd)
  so the pwd would not print out each iteration.
  Also, please note that you have to put a new line at the end of the batch file
  EXAMPLE: batch File --> 1) ls
                          2) ls | wc
                          3) ps -l | grep Shell >> out.txt
               Empty -->  4) 
    
    - EXPLANATION: I initially wanted to auto mate it by reading the argv
      but when I use redirect in '<', argv does not grab that varible. It only
      has ./Shell
        * Bash> ./Shell < batch.txt
                print argv[0] --> ./Shell
                print argv[1] --> NULL
      It does not grab that anything after a redirection
